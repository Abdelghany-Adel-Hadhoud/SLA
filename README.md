this application to calculate the SLA deadline of a captured complaint based on the configured working hours.
When a complaint is captured it should have a maximum time to get resolved.
Some low priority complaints can have 24 hours but some high priority
complaints can have 4 hours to be resolved. All hours are business hours.
For this reason you are expected
to develop a database structure to store operating hours and business closures such as weekends,
national and religious holidays.
If a complaint is captured just before a national holiday,
since we are counting for business hours only it should skip the non working hours during the national holiday.
this app shoild gives the resolution deadline for a given complaint type.
